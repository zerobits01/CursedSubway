1. i have a global time(it changes 6 minutes 6 minutes) it increases if and only if the 4 lines have generated the data
2. i can use 4 threads for each line => so i have to use a kinda mutex or sth like that to generate values and ...
2.1. all of the arrays are shared buffers so that we can use them for checking the hub stations
	people from input rate shouldnt be outputed - so maximumly at each state we can have output rate of last station
3. each line checks the time if the time is changed the main thread increases the time
4. these are the base ideas


# i am really different!



we have 4 subway lines with 19 stations

each station a poasson distribution between 30 to 40
start stations only input / last stations only output

dataset: (station-name, date-time, input, output)

each line has 6 stations
we have hub stations
each 30 minutes a subway starts from each start-station
between each station we have 6 minutes time(from starting statation to last 30 minutes)

1  => 2  => 3  => 4  => 5  => 6
0  => 6  => 12 => 18 => 24 => 30
6  => 12 => 18 => 24 => 30 => 36

satari  => valiasr  => jahad    => beheshti   => heravi     => ghaem
azadi   => teatr    => ferdowsi => dolat      => shemiran   => bouali

dolat      => hub 1_4
mohammadie => hub 1_2
teatr      => hub 2_4
valiasr    => hub 2_3
beheshti   => hub 1_3


distributions:
=> start statoins: poasson 30 to 40
=> hub station output: 15 to 20
=> normal station output: 8 to 12
=> all station except starting points input(including hubs): 10 to 14
=> last station output: all the people

what can be the problems:
1. output more than input
2. hub station distribution
3. ....

#implementing that
#implement the graph design
#implement dataset for 30 days, i gave the idea with shared arrays and also multithreaded(start from 6 last subway starts since 21:30)

#implement: for each statation train a model to predict output
#implement: " " input
#implement: " " at each time predict the people inside of metro
#implement: " " the poasson rate for each station
#implement: choose a good validation param test it and show why its good

why choosing each model? i wanna use polinomial regression
save the models and outputs

so if we gonna train model for each station i can save the data for each of them seperately(i can say that i have generated and saved that and i have seperated that with groupby in pandas)

pay attention that people coming as input cannot be output / only people in the subway can get out(you have to pay attention tolimit it)
